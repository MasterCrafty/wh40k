Hi guys,

Just working on a gladius with 2x demi companies and an auxialiary.., this should provide free transports, but that doesn't seemnto have been coded insto Bscribe..., is this on the list to fix?

Also any word on the FW updates and the special stuff FW chapters get (firehawk hand flamers and jump pack command squads)

Thanks for all your work guys, 

Appreciated.
